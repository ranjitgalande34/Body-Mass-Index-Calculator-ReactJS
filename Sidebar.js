Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value calculated from an individual's weight and height. It provides a rough estimate of body fat and is commonly used to categorize weight status into underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese ranges. While BMI offers a quick assessment, it doesn't account for factors like muscle mass or distribution of fat. It's important to consider BMI alongside other health indicators for a comprehensive understanding of one's overall well-being. Always consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation of health and weight management.
